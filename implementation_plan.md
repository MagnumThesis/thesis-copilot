# Implementation Plan: Fix Chat API 404 Errors

## Overview
The frontend application is receiving 404 errors when attempting to create new chats because the worker routes are not properly configured. The worker has the necessary chat handlers implemented but they are not registered with the main Hono application. This implementation will fix the routing configuration to properly handle all chat-related API endpoints.

## Root Cause
- Frontend makes requests to `/api/chats/*` endpoints
- Worker only defines routes for `/api/ai-searcher/*` endpoints
- Chat handlers exist but are not properly routed

## Files to be Modified

### 1. src/worker/index.ts
**Current State:** Only contains `/api/ai-searcher/*` routes
**Required Changes:**
- Import chat handlers (chats.ts, messages.ts, generate-title.ts)
- Add routes for `/api/chats` endpoints:
  - `GET /api/chats` → getChatsHandler
  - `POST /api/chats` → createChatHandler
  - `DELETE /api/chats/:id` → deleteChatHandler
  - `PATCH /api/chats/:id` → updateChatHandler
  - `GET /api/chats/:id/messages` → getMessagesHandler
  - `POST /api/generate-title` → generateTitleHandler

### 2. No new files needed
The handlers already exist in the correct locations.

## Implementation Order

1. **Update worker/index.ts routing configuration**
   - Import all necessary chat handlers
   - Register routes with Hono app
   - Ensure proper error handling

2. **Test the implementation**
   - Verify all endpoints are accessible
   - Test chat creation functionality
   - Confirm error messages are resolved

## Dependencies
- No new dependencies required
- All handlers are already implemented
- Supabase integration is already configured

## Testing
**Test Scenarios:**
- Create new chat → Should return 201 with chat data
- Fetch chats → Should return 200 with chat list
- Delete chat → Should return 200 success
- Update chat → Should return 200 with updated data
- Fetch messages → Should return 200 with message list
- Generate title → Should return 200 with generated title

**Expected Results:**
- All 404 errors resolved
- Chat functionality works as expected
- Proper error handling for edge cases

## Implementation Steps

1. Import chat handlers in worker/index.ts
2. Add route definitions for all chat endpoints
3. Ensure CORS is properly configured
4. Test the implementation with the frontend
