        This thesis aims to investigate the impact of artificial intelligence on educational outcomes.
        The research problem focuses on understanding how AI technologies can enhance learning experiences.
        The main argument of this study is that AI-powered personalized learning systems significantly improve student performance.
        
        # Literature Review
        Previous research has extensively examined the role of technology in education (Smith, 2020; Johnson, 2019).
        Studies indicate that personalized learning approaches show promising results (Brown et al., 2021).
        However, limited research exists on the specific impact of AI-driven systems (Davis, 2020).
        
        # Research Questions
        This study addresses the following research questions:
        1. How does AI-powered personalized learning affect student engagement?
        2. What factors influence the effectiveness of AI educational systems?
        
        # Methodology
        This research employs a mixed-methods approach combining quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews.
        Data collection will involve 200 students across multiple institutions over a six-month period.
        The analysis will utilize statistical methods and thematic coding techniques.
        
        # Significance
        This research contributes to educational technology literature by providing empirical evidence.
        The findings will have important implications for educational policy and practice.
        
        # Timeline
        The research will be conducted over 18 months, with data collection in months 6-12.
        Analysis and writing will occur in the final six months of the project.
        
        # Limitations
        The study is limited to undergraduate students in STEM fields.
        The scope excludes K-12 educational contexts due to resource constraints.
