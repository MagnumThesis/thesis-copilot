# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Proofreader Tool feature enhances the Thesis Copilot application by providing an AI-powered proofreading capability that analyzes thesis proposals and idea definitions to identify areas of concern. Unlike the existing AI Builder Integration which focuses on content generation and modification, the Proofreader Tool serves as a review and analysis system that helps users identify potential issues in their thesis proposals without automatically making changes. The tool provides structured feedback with status tracking, allowing users to manage and address concerns at their own pace.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a thesis writer, I want an AI proofreader to analyze my thesis proposal and list areas of concern, so that I can identify potential issues and improve the quality of my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user activates the proofreader tool THEN the system SHALL read the current thesis proposal content from the Builder tool
2. WHEN the proofreader analyzes the content THEN the system SHALL generate a list of concerns with specific descriptions
3. WHEN concerns are identified THEN the system SHALL present them in a structured format similar to the Idealist tool interface
4. WHEN the proofreader completes analysis THEN the system SHALL display all concerns without automatically modifying the original content
5. IF the thesis proposal is empty or insufficient THEN the system SHALL notify the user that more content is needed for effective proofreading

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a thesis writer, I want the proofreader to consider my idea definitions when analyzing my proposal, so that the feedback is contextually relevant to my specific thesis topic and terminology.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the proofreader analyzes content THEN the system SHALL retrieve and incorporate idea definitions from the Idealist tool
2. WHEN idea definitions exist THEN the system SHALL use them as context to understand domain-specific terminology and concepts
3. WHEN analyzing consistency THEN the system SHALL check if the proposal aligns with the defined ideas and concepts
4. WHEN generating concerns THEN the system SHALL reference specific idea definitions when relevant
5. IF idea definitions are missing or incomplete THEN the system SHALL still provide general proofreading feedback

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a thesis writer, I want to track the status of proofreading concerns, so that I can manage my revision process and keep track of what I've addressed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN concerns are generated THEN the system SHALL assign each concern an initial status of "To be done"
2. WHEN the user reviews a concern THEN the system SHALL allow them to change the status to "Addressed" or "Rejected"
3. WHEN the user updates concern status THEN the system SHALL persist the status changes for future sessions
4. WHEN displaying concerns THEN the system SHALL visually indicate the current status of each concern
5. WHEN the user filters concerns THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by status (To be done, Addressed, Rejected)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a thesis writer, I want the proofreader to focus only on analysis and feedback, so that I maintain full control over my document and can decide how to address each concern.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the proofreader identifies concerns THEN the system SHALL NOT automatically modify the thesis proposal content
2. WHEN presenting concerns THEN the system SHALL provide descriptive feedback without commanding or directing specific actions
3. WHEN the user views concerns THEN the system SHALL present them as suggestions and observations rather than mandatory changes
4. WHEN concerns are listed THEN the system SHALL allow the user to manually address them in the Builder tool
5. IF the user wants to make changes THEN the system SHALL require them to manually edit the content using existing Builder functionality

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a thesis writer, I want the proofreader interface to be consistent with the existing Idealist tool design, so that I can easily navigate and understand the feedback system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the proofreader displays concerns THEN the system SHALL use a similar visual format to the Idealist tool
2. WHEN showing concern details THEN the system SHALL provide expandable sections for detailed feedback
3. WHEN displaying status indicators THEN the system SHALL use clear visual cues consistent with the application's design system
4. WHEN the user interacts with concerns THEN the system SHALL provide familiar interaction patterns from the Idealist tool
5. WHEN integrating with the Builder tool THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing workflow and navigation patterns

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a thesis writer, I want the proofreader to provide comprehensive analysis covering different aspects of academic writing, so that I can improve multiple dimensions of my thesis proposal.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing content THEN the system SHALL check for clarity and coherence issues
2. WHEN reviewing structure THEN the system SHALL identify problems with logical flow and organization
3. WHEN examining academic style THEN the system SHALL flag inappropriate tone or formatting issues
4. WHEN checking consistency THEN the system SHALL identify contradictions or inconsistent terminology
5. WHEN evaluating completeness THEN the system SHALL highlight missing sections or insufficient detail
6. WHEN analyzing citations THEN the system SHALL identify potential citation and reference issues

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper database migrations for the proofreader functionality, so that the database schema can be updated safely and all necessary tables and relationships are created.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the proofreader feature THEN the system SHALL provide migration scripts to create the required database tables
2. WHEN creating migrations THEN the system SHALL include proper indexes for performance optimization
3. WHEN setting up the database THEN the system SHALL create foreign key relationships to maintain data integrity
4. WHEN providing database setup THEN the system SHALL include a comprehensive new_db.sql file for fresh installations
5. WHEN creating tables THEN the system SHALL use appropriate data types and constraints for all proofreading-related data
6. WHEN establishing relationships THEN the system SHALL ensure proper cascading behavior for data cleanup
