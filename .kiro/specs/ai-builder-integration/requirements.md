# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Builder Integration feature enhances the existing Builder tool in the Thesis Copilot application by integrating AI capabilities to assist users in creating and modifying their thesis proposal documents. This feature provides multiple interaction modes that allow users to leverage AI assistance while maintaining control over their document creation process. The integration supports different workflows including prompt-based generation, content continuation, and selective text modification through an intuitive action toolbar interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a thesis writer, I want to use AI prompts to generate content for my proposal, so that I can quickly create initial drafts and overcome writer's block.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects "Prompt mode" from the action toolbar THEN the system SHALL display a prompt input interface
2. WHEN the user enters a prompt and submits it THEN the system SHALL send the prompt to the AI service and display the generated content
3. WHEN the AI generates content THEN the system SHALL allow the user to insert, replace, or discard the generated content
4. IF the AI service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and allow the user to retry
5. WHEN the user submits a prompt THEN the system SHALL maintain the context of the current document for relevant content generation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a thesis writer, I want to continue generating content from where I left off, so that I can maintain consistency and flow in my document.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects "Continue generating mode" from the action toolbar THEN the system SHALL analyze the current cursor position and surrounding content
2. WHEN the user activates continue mode THEN the system SHALL generate content that logically follows the existing text
3. WHEN content is generated in continue mode THEN the system SHALL maintain the writing style and tone of the existing document
4. WHEN the user has selected text before activating continue mode THEN the system SHALL use the selected text as context for continuation
5. IF there is insufficient context for continuation THEN the system SHALL prompt the user for additional guidance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a thesis writer, I want to modify selected content using AI, so that I can improve specific sections without affecting the entire document.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects text in the document THEN the system SHALL enable the "Modify selected content/text mode" option in the action toolbar
2. WHEN the user activates modify mode with selected text THEN the system SHALL provide options for modification types (rewrite, expand, summarize, improve clarity)
3. WHEN the user chooses a modification type THEN the system SHALL process the selected text and provide AI-generated alternatives
4. WHEN modifications are generated THEN the system SHALL allow the user to preview changes before applying them
5. WHEN the user applies modifications THEN the system SHALL replace the selected text with the chosen modification
6. IF no text is selected THEN the system SHALL disable the modify mode option in the action toolbar

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a thesis writer, I want an intuitive action toolbar to choose between different AI modes, so that I can easily switch between different types of AI assistance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the Builder tool THEN the system SHALL display an action toolbar with clearly labeled mode options
2. WHEN the user hovers over toolbar buttons THEN the system SHALL display tooltips explaining each mode's functionality
3. WHEN the user selects a mode THEN the system SHALL visually indicate the active mode and update the interface accordingly
4. WHEN switching between modes THEN the system SHALL preserve any unsaved work and maintain document state
5. WHEN a mode is not available (e.g., modify mode without selected text) THEN the system SHALL visually disable the corresponding toolbar button
6. WHEN the user is in any AI mode THEN the system SHALL provide a clear way to cancel or exit the mode

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a thesis writer, I want the AI integration to work seamlessly with the existing markdown-based Builder tool, so that I can maintain my current workflow while benefiting from AI assistance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI generates content THEN the system SHALL format the output as valid markdown
2. WHEN the user inserts AI-generated content THEN the system SHALL maintain proper markdown formatting and document structure
3. WHEN the AI processes existing content THEN the system SHALL preserve markdown syntax and formatting
4. WHEN the user switches between manual editing and AI modes THEN the system SHALL maintain document integrity and formatting
5. WHEN AI content is inserted THEN the system SHALL integrate seamlessly with existing document sections and maintain proper heading hierarchy

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a thesis writer, I want the AI to understand the context of my thesis proposal, so that generated content is relevant and appropriate for academic writing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI generates content THEN the system SHALL use the existing document content as context for relevant generation
2. WHEN the user has defined ideas in the Idealist tool THEN the system SHALL incorporate those definitions into AI-generated content when relevant
3. WHEN generating academic content THEN the system SHALL maintain appropriate academic tone and style
4. WHEN the AI suggests content THEN the system SHALL ensure it aligns with thesis proposal structure and requirements
5. IF the document contains citations or references THEN the system SHALL maintain proper academic citation format in generated content
