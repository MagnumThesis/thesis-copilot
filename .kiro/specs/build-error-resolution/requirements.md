# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Build Error Resolution feature aims to systematically identify, categorize, and resolve all errors that occur during the build process of the Thesis Copilot application. This feature will enhance the development workflow by providing developers with clear guidance on how to address build issues, reducing debugging time and improving code quality. The system will automatically detect build errors, analyze their root causes, and suggest or implement appropriate fixes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to automatically detect and categorize all build errors, so that I can quickly understand what is preventing the application from building successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process encounters an error THEN the system SHALL capture the error message, file location, and line number
2. WHEN errors are detected THEN the system SHALL categorize them into types (syntax errors, type errors, missing dependencies, etc.)
3. WHEN multiple errors occur THEN the system SHALL prioritize them based on severity and impact on the build
4. WHEN errors are displayed THEN the system SHALL provide clear, actionable descriptions for each error

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to provide detailed analysis of each build error, so that I can understand the root cause and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error is detected THEN the system SHALL analyze the context in which it occurred
2. WHEN analyzing errors THEN the system SHALL provide explanations of what went wrong in plain language
3. WHEN errors have common solutions THEN the system SHALL suggest relevant documentation or examples
4. WHEN errors are complex THEN the system SHALL break them down into simpler, understandable components

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to suggest or implement fixes for build errors, so that I can resolve issues more efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error is analyzed THEN the system SHALL generate potential solutions based on the error type
2. WHEN solutions are available THEN the system SHALL rank them by effectiveness and safety
3. WHEN a solution is suggested THEN the system SHALL provide a clear explanation of what the fix will do
4. WHEN a user accepts a fix THEN the system SHALL either automatically apply it or provide clear instructions for manual application

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to track the status of build errors and their resolutions, so that I can monitor progress and ensure all issues are addressed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors are detected THEN the system SHALL log them with timestamps and status indicators
2. WHEN errors are resolved THEN the system SHALL update their status to "fixed" or "resolved"
3. WHEN errors persist THEN the system SHALL allow users to mark them as "in progress" or "requires attention"
4. WHEN reviewing errors THEN the system SHALL provide filtering and sorting options by status, type, and date

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to integrate with the existing development environment, so that I can address build errors without leaving my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display notifications within the development environment
2. WHEN error details are viewed THEN the system SHALL provide direct links to the problematic files and lines
3. WHEN fixes are applied THEN the system SHALL automatically re-run the build process to verify resolution
4. WHEN errors are resolved THEN the system SHALL update the development environment status indicators

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to learn from past errors and resolutions, so that it can improve its suggestions over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors are resolved THEN the system SHALL store the error patterns and solutions
2. WHEN similar errors occur THEN the system SHALL reference previous solutions to provide better suggestions
3. WHEN users provide feedback on solutions THEN the system SHALL use this information to refine future recommendations
4. WHEN error patterns emerge THEN the system SHALL identify common causes and proactively suggest preventive measures

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to handle different types of build errors appropriately, so that all issues can be resolved effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN syntax errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide specific guidance on correcting the syntax
2. WHEN type errors occur THEN the system SHALL explain the type mismatch and suggest compatible types
3. WHEN dependency errors occur THEN the system SHALL recommend the correct installation or configuration steps
4. WHEN configuration errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for correcting the configuration files
5. WHEN environment errors occur THEN the system SHALL suggest appropriate environment setup or changes
