# Implementation Plan: Comprehensive Codebase Documentation

This document breaks down the implementation of the comprehensive codebase documentation feature into a series of actionable tasks. These tasks are designed to be executed by a code-generation LLM in a test-driven manner.

### 1. Setup and Configuration

- [X] **1.1. Install and configure Vocs**
    - Install Vocs as a dev dependency.
    - Create a `doc-site` directory for the Vocs project.
    - Configure the Vocs project with a title, sidebar navigation, and other basic settings.
    - *Requirement: 1.1, 1.2*

- [X] **1.2. Install and configure TypeDoc**
    - Install `typedoc` and `typedoc-plugin-markdown` as dev dependencies.
    - Create a `typedoc.json` configuration file to define the entry points for the documentation generation and the output directory.
    - *Requirement: 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3*

- [X] **1.3. Set up ESLint for TSDoc**
    - Install `eslint-plugin-jsdoc` as a dev dependency.
    - Configure ESLint to enforce TSDoc standards for all TypeScript files.
    - *Requirement: 4.1, 4.2*

### 2. TSDoc Implementation

- [X] **2.1. Document `src/lib` directory**
    - Add TSDoc comments to all functions and classes in the `src/lib` directory.
    - Ensure that all exported members have a clear description, parameter and return value documentation, and examples where applicable.
    - *Requirement: 4.1, 4.2*

- [X] **2.2. Document `src/hooks` directory**
    - Add TSDoc comments to all custom hooks in the `src/hooks` directory.
    - *Requirement: 2.2, 4.1, 4.2*

- [ ] **2.3. Document `src/components` directory**
    - Add TSDoc comments to all React components in the `src/components` directory.
    - Document the purpose of each component and the props it accepts.
    - *Requirement: 2.1, 4.1, 4.2*

- [ ] **2.4. Document `src/worker` directory**
    - Add TSDoc comments to all handlers and functions in the `src/worker` directory.
    - *Requirement: 3.1, 4.1, 4.2*

### 3. Documentation Generation and CI/CD

- [ ] **3.1. Create a script to generate documentation**
    - Create a new npm script that runs TypeDoc to generate Markdown files from the TSDoc comments, and then runs Vocs to build the static documentation site.
    - *Requirement: 1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1*

- [ ] **3.2. Integrate documentation generation into CI/CD**
    - Create a new workflow in the CI/CD pipeline that runs the documentation generation script on every push to the `main` branch.
    - Configure the workflow to deploy the generated documentation site to a hosting service (e.g., Cloudflare Pages).
    - *Requirement: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3*
