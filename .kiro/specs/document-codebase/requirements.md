# Feature: Comprehensive Codebase Documentation

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for creating a comprehensive and detailed documentation for the entire Thesis Copilot codebase. The goal is to ensure that all aspects of the project, from the high-level architecture to the low-level implementation details of each component, are thoroughly documented. This will improve maintainability, onboarding of new developers, and knowledge sharing within the team.

## 2. Requirements

### 2.1. System-Level Documentation

| Requirement | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | As a developer, I want to understand the high-level architecture of the system, so that I can get a quick overview of how the different parts of the application work together. | - **GIVEN** a developer is new to the project **WHEN** they look at the documentation **THEN** the system shall provide a clear and up-to-date architecture diagram and a description of the main components (frontend, backend, database). |
| 1.2 | As a developer, I want to have a detailed project structure documentation, so that I can easily navigate the codebase and find the files I need. | - **GIVEN** a developer is exploring the codebase **WHEN** they consult the project structure documentation **THEN** the system shall provide a detailed explanation of the purpose of each directory and important file in the project. |
| 1.3 | As a developer, I want to have a clear guide on how to set up the development environment, so that I can start contributing to the project as quickly as possible. | - **GIVEN** a new developer is setting up their environment **WHEN** they follow the setup guide **THEN** the system shall provide step-by-step instructions for installing dependencies, configuring the environment, and running the application locally. |

### 2.2. Frontend Documentation

| Requirement | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| 2.1 | As a frontend developer, I want to have a detailed documentation for each React component, so that I can understand its purpose, props, and usage. | - **GIVEN** a developer is working with a React component **WHEN** they look at its documentation **THEN** the system shall provide a clear description of the component's functionality, a list of its props with their types and default values, and examples of how to use it. |
| 2.2 | As a frontend developer, I want to have a documentation for each React hook, so that I can understand its purpose, arguments, and return values. | - **GIVEN** a developer is using a React hook **WHEN** they look at its documentation **THEN** the system shall provide a clear description of the hook's functionality, its parameters, and what it returns. |
| 2.3 | As a frontend developer, I want to understand the state management strategy, so that I can manage the application state effectively. | - **GIVEN** a developer is working on a new feature **WHEN** they consult the documentation **THEN** the system shall provide a clear explanation of the state management approach, including the use of React hooks and context. |

### 2.3. Backend Documentation

| Requirement | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| 3.1 | As a backend developer, I want to have a detailed documentation for each API endpoint, so that I can understand its purpose, request format, and response format. | - **GIVEN** a developer is interacting with the backend API **WHEN** they look at the API documentation **THEN** the system shall provide a clear description of each endpoint, including its URL, HTTP method, request parameters, and response payload. |
| 3.2 | As a backend developer, I want to understand the AI integration, so that I can extend or debug the AI-powered features. | - **GIVEN** a developer is working on AI features **WHEN** they consult the documentation **THEN** the system shall provide a detailed explanation of how the application integrates with the Google Generative AI API. |
| 3.3 | As a backend developer, I want to understand the database schema and interactions, so that I can work with the database effectively. | - **GIVEN** a developer is working with the database **WHEN** they look at the documentation **THEN** the system shall provide an up-to-date database schema diagram and a description of how the backend interacts with the database. |

### 2.4. Code-Level Documentation

| Requirement | User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| 4.1 | As a developer, I want to have clear and concise comments in the code, so that I can understand the purpose of complex functions and logic. | - **GIVEN** a developer is reading the source code **WHEN** they encounter a complex piece of logic **THEN** the system shall provide comments that explain the "why" behind the code, not just the "what". |
| 4.2 | As a developer, I want all functions and classes to have JSDoc/TSDoc comments, so that I can get autocompletion and type information in my IDE. | - **GIVEN** a developer is writing code **WHEN** they use a function or class **THEN** the system shall provide JSDoc/TSDoc comments that describe the purpose, parameters, and return values. |
