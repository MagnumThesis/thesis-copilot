# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for fixing the TypeScript compilation errors that currently prevent the Thesis Copilot application from building successfully. The errors are occurring during the `npm run build` process, specifically in the TypeScript compilation phase. The goal is to identify and resolve all syntax errors in the codebase to allow the application to build successfully.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fix all TypeScript compilation errors in the codebase, so that the application can build successfully using `npm run build`.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the developer runs `npm run build` THEN the system SHALL compile all TypeScript files without errors
2. WHEN the build process completes THEN the system SHALL generate the production-ready application bundle
3. WHEN the application is built THEN the system SHALL not produce any TypeScript compilation errors
4. WHEN the application is built THEN the system SHALL not produce any syntax errors that prevent compilation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify and fix syntax errors in specific files, so that I can resolve the build issues efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the build errors THEN the system SHALL identify all files with syntax errors
2. WHEN identifying errors in src/components/ui/chat.tsx THEN the system SHALL fix the "Expression expected" and "Unterminated regular expression literal" errors
3. WHEN identifying errors in src/components/ui/sidebar.tsx THEN the system SHALL fix all "Declaration or statement expected", "Expression expected", "';' expected", and "Unterminated template literal" errors
4. WHEN identifying errors in src/worker/handlers/search-analytics.ts THEN the system SHALL fix the "'*/' expected" error

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure that the fixes don't introduce new issues, so that the application remains functional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the fixes are applied THEN the system SHALL not break existing functionality
2. WHEN the application is rebuilt THEN the system SHALL pass all existing tests
3. WHEN the application is run THEN the system SHALL maintain all current features and behavior
4. WHEN code changes are made THEN the system SHALL follow existing coding conventions and patterns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that all errors are resolved, so that I can confidently deploy the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all fixes are implemented THEN the system SHALL successfully execute `npm run build` without errors
2. WHEN the build is successful THEN the system SHALL produce all necessary output files in the dist directory
3. WHEN the build is successful THEN the system SHALL not show any TypeScript compilation warnings
4. WHEN the build is successful THEN the system SHALL be ready for deployment

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to understand the root causes of the errors, so that I can prevent similar issues in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fixing each error THEN the system SHALL document the root cause of the issue
2. WHEN errors are resolved THEN the system SHALL identify patterns in the types of errors that occurred
3. WHEN the fix process is complete THEN the system SHALL provide recommendations for preventing similar errors
4. WHEN future development occurs THEN the system SHALL have improved processes to catch syntax errors early
