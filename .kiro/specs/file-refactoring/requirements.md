# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on breaking down large, monolithic files in the Thesis Copilot codebase into smaller, more manageable modules. The goal is to improve code maintainability, readability, and developer experience by following single responsibility principles and creating a more modular architecture.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want large files to be broken down into smaller, focused modules, so that I can more easily understand, maintain, and test individual components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file exceeds 500 lines THEN the system SHALL identify it as a candidate for refactoring
2. WHEN breaking down a file THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality without breaking changes
3. WHEN creating new modules THEN each module SHALL have a single, clear responsibility
4. WHEN refactoring THEN all TypeScript types and interfaces SHALL be preserved and properly exported
5. WHEN splitting files THEN all existing imports in other files SHALL continue to work through proper re-exports

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the project structure to follow consistent patterns, so that I can quickly locate and understand code organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating new modules THEN they SHALL follow the established naming conventions (kebab-case for files, PascalCase for components)
2. WHEN organizing modules THEN they SHALL be grouped by feature or responsibility in appropriate subdirectories
3. WHEN creating index files THEN they SHALL provide clean public APIs through selective exports
4. WHEN refactoring THEN the new structure SHALL align with the existing project architecture patterns

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want large service and utility files to be modularized, so that I can work with specific functionality without loading unnecessary code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring service files THEN each service SHALL be split by functional domain
2. WHEN breaking down utility files THEN related utilities SHALL be grouped together
3. WHEN creating new modules THEN they SHALL have clear, descriptive names that indicate their purpose
4. WHEN splitting large files THEN circular dependencies SHALL be avoided
5. WHEN modularizing THEN each module SHALL be independently testable

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want large React components to be broken into smaller, reusable components, so that I can better manage complexity and improve reusability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a React component exceeds 300 lines THEN it SHALL be evaluated for component extraction
2. WHEN extracting components THEN each component SHALL have a single, focused responsibility
3. WHEN creating sub-components THEN they SHALL be properly typed with TypeScript interfaces
4. WHEN refactoring components THEN all props and state management SHALL be preserved
5. WHEN breaking down components THEN accessibility features SHALL be maintained

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test files to be organized alongside their corresponding modules, so that I can easily maintain and run relevant tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring modules THEN corresponding test files SHALL be updated to match the new structure
2. WHEN creating new modules THEN test coverage SHALL be maintained or improved
3. WHEN organizing tests THEN they SHALL follow the same modular structure as the source code
4. WHEN splitting test files THEN all test scenarios SHALL continue to pass
5. WHEN refactoring THEN test imports SHALL be updated to use the new module structure

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation of the refactoring changes, so that I can understand the new structure and migration path.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring is complete THEN a migration guide SHALL document the structural changes
2. WHEN creating new modules THEN each module SHALL have appropriate JSDoc comments
3. WHEN changing file organization THEN the project structure documentation SHALL be updated
4. WHEN refactoring THEN breaking changes (if any) SHALL be clearly documented
5. WHEN completing refactoring THEN examples SHALL be provided for common usage patterns
