# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for resolving the remaining TypeScript type errors in the Thesis Copilot application. While the previous build-error-fixes spec successfully resolved syntax errors, the application still fails to build due to numerous type-related errors. These errors prevent the application from being compiled and deployed successfully. The goal is to identify and resolve all TypeScript type errors to allow the application to build successfully using `npm run build`.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to fix all TypeScript type errors in the codebase, so that the application can build successfully using `npm run build`.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the developer runs `npm run build` THEN the system SHALL compile all TypeScript files without type errors
2. WHEN the build process completes THEN the system SHALL generate the production-ready application bundle
3. WHEN the application is built THEN the system SHALL not produce any TypeScript type errors
4. WHEN the application is built THEN the system SHALL not produce any type compatibility issues that prevent compilation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify and fix type errors in specific files, so that I can resolve the build issues efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the build errors THEN the system SHALL identify all files with type errors
2. WHEN identifying errors in src/components/ui/concern-detail.tsx THEN the system SHALL fix all "Expected corresponding JSX closing tag" errors
3. WHEN identifying errors in src/lib/ai-searcher-performance-optimizer.ts THEN the system SHALL fix all "Property does not exist on type" errors
4. WHEN identifying errors in src/worker/handlers/ai-searcher-api.ts THEN the system SHALL fix all "Argument not assignable to parameter" errors
5. WHEN identifying errors in other files THEN the system SHALL fix similar type errors throughout the codebase

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure that the fixes don't introduce new issues, so that the application remains functional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the fixes are applied THEN the system SHALL not break existing functionality
2. WHEN the application is rebuilt THEN the system SHALL pass all existing tests
3. WHEN the application is run THEN the system SHALL maintain all current features and behavior
4. WHEN code changes are made THEN the system SHALL follow existing coding conventions and patterns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that all errors are resolved, so that I can confidently deploy the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all fixes are implemented THEN the system SHALL successfully execute `npm run build` without errors
2. WHEN the build is successful THEN the system SHALL produce all necessary output files in the dist directory
3. WHEN the build is successful THEN the system SHALL not show any TypeScript compilation warnings
4. WHEN the build is successful THEN the system SHALL be ready for deployment

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to understand the root causes of the type errors, so that I can prevent similar issues in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fixing each error THEN the system SHALL document the root cause of the type issue
2. WHEN errors are resolved THEN the system SHALL identify patterns in the types of type errors that occurred
3. WHEN the fix process is complete THEN the system SHALL provide recommendations for preventing similar type errors
4. WHEN future development occurs THEN the system SHALL have improved processes to catch type errors early
