# Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for fixing the remaining TypeScript type errors in the Thesis Copilot application. The plan follows a systematic approach, addressing errors by category and verifying fixes at each step.

## Current Status

The previous spec successfully resolved syntax errors, but the build is still failing with numerous type-related errors:

- Total errors: Approximately 200+ errors
- Most common error types:
  - TS17002: Expected corresponding JSX closing tag (multiple instances)
  - TS2339: Property 'X' does not exist on type 'Y' (53 errors)
  - TS18046: 'X' is of type 'unknown' (47 errors)
  - TS2345: Argument of type 'X' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Y' (16 errors)
  - TS2322: Type 'X' is not assignable to type 'Y' (14 errors)
  - TS2739: Type 'X' is missing the following properties from type 'Y' (8 errors)

These are type-related errors indicating issues with type definitions and type usage throughout the codebase.

## Tasks

1. [ ] Create enhanced error analysis script
   - Enhance the existing script to better categorize type errors
   - Add functionality to group errors by file and error type
   - Implement detailed error reporting
   - Reference: Requirement 2.1 (Identify files with type errors)

2. [ ] Fix JSX closing tag errors in concern-detail.tsx
   - Locate all missing or mismatched JSX closing tags
   - Properly close all JSX elements
   - Run `npm run build` to verify the errors are resolved
   - Reference: Requirement 2.2 (Fix concern-detail.tsx errors)

3. [ ] Fix property access errors in ai-searcher-performance-optimizer.ts
   - Examine the generic type 'T' and 'lastAccessed' property issues
   - Add proper type constraints or type guards
   - Run `npm run build` to verify the errors are resolved
   - Reference: Requirement 2.3 (Fix property access errors)

4. [ ] Fix argument assignment errors in ai-searcher-api.ts
   - Analyze the function parameter type mismatches
   - Adjust argument types or function signatures to match
   - Run `npm run build` to verify the errors are resolved
   - Reference: Requirement 2.4 (Fix argument assignment errors)

5. [ ] Fix remaining type errors in other files
   - Systematically address type errors in other affected files
   - Fix "Property does not exist on type" errors
   - Resolve "Argument not assignable to parameter" errors
   - Address "Type not assignable to type" errors
   - Fix "Type missing properties" errors
   - Handle "is of type unknown" errors
   - Run `npm run build` after each fix to verify progress
   - Reference: Requirement 2.5 (Fix other type errors)

6. [ ] Verify complete build success
   - Run `npm run build` to ensure all errors are resolved
   - Confirm that the build completes without TypeScript compilation errors
   - Verify that all necessary output files are generated in the dist directory
   - Reference: Requirement 1.1, 4.1 (Build without errors)

7. [ ] Run regression tests
   - Used `npm run test -- --bail=10` for running tests
   - Execute existing automated tests to verify no regressions
   - Manually test key application features to ensure functionality remains intact
   - Reference: Requirement 3.1, 3.2 (No broken functionality)

8. [ ] Document root causes and prevention strategies
   - Document the root cause of each error fixed
   - Identify patterns in the types of errors that occurred
   - Provide recommendations for preventing similar errors in the future
   - Reference: Requirement 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 (Understand root causes)
