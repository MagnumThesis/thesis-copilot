# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Referencer Tool is a feature that enables users to manage, insert, and format references and citations within their documents. This tool will help users maintain consistent citation formatting, track sources, and ensure proper attribution in their written content.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to add and manage references in my documents, so that I can properly cite sources and maintain academic or professional standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects text THEN the system SHALL provide an option to add a reference
2. WHEN a user adds a reference THEN the system SHALL store the reference details (title, author, URL, date, etc.)
3. WHEN a user adds a reference THEN the system SHALL automatically format the citation according to selected style (APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.)
4. WHEN a user views a document THEN the system SHALL display inline citations and a reference list

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to import references from external sources, so that I can quickly add citations without manual data entry.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a URL THEN the system SHALL attempt to extract reference metadata automatically
2. WHEN a user provides a DOI THEN the system SHALL fetch complete citation information
3. WHEN automatic extraction fails THEN the system SHALL allow manual entry of reference details
4. WHEN importing references THEN the system SHALL validate required fields for the selected citation style

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a writer, I want to switch between different citation styles, so that I can adapt my document to different publication requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a citation style THEN the system SHALL reformat all existing citations to match
2. WHEN switching styles THEN the system SHALL preserve all reference data
3. WHEN a style is applied THEN the system SHALL update both inline citations and the reference list
4. IF a reference lacks required fields for a style THEN the system SHALL highlight missing information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a collaborative writer, I want to share and sync references across team members, so that we can maintain consistent citations in shared documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user shares a document THEN the system SHALL include all reference data
2. WHEN multiple users edit references THEN the system SHALL handle conflicts gracefully
3. WHEN references are updated THEN the system SHALL sync changes across all collaborators
4. WHEN a reference is deleted THEN the system SHALL warn about orphaned citations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a document editor, I want to validate and check references, so that I can ensure all citations are complete and properly formatted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs reference validation THEN the system SHALL identify incomplete citations
2. WHEN validation runs THEN the system SHALL check for broken URLs or invalid DOIs
3. WHEN citations are orphaned THEN the system SHALL highlight them for review
4. WHEN the reference list is generated THEN the system SHALL sort entries according to style requirements

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to maintain a persistent list of all my references, so that I can manage my bibliography across multiple documents and sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user adds a reference THEN the system SHALL store it in a persistent reference library
2. WHEN a user opens the referencer tool THEN the system SHALL display all saved references for the current conversation
3. WHEN a user deletes a reference THEN the system SHALL remove it from the library and warn about existing citations
4. WHEN a user edits reference details THEN the system SHALL update all associated citations automatically
5. WHEN a user searches references THEN the system SHALL provide filtering by author, title, year, or type
6. WHEN a user exports references THEN the system SHALL generate bibliography files in common formats (BibTeX, RIS, EndNote)
