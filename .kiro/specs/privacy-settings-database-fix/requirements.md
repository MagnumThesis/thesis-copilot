# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The privacy settings functionality is currently failing when users try to update their privacy and data consent settings. The error occurs because the database upsert operation is trying to use an ON CONFLICT clause with columns that don't have a unique constraint. This prevents users from properly managing their privacy settings, which is a critical feature for GDPR compliance and user data management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to update my privacy settings without encountering database errors, so that I can control how my data is processed and stored.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user updates their privacy settings THEN the system SHALL successfully save the settings without database constraint errors
2. WHEN a user has existing privacy settings THEN the system SHALL update the existing record instead of creating duplicates
3. WHEN a user updates privacy settings for a specific conversation THEN the system SHALL handle conversation-specific settings correctly
4. WHEN a user updates global privacy settings THEN the system SHALL handle null conversation_id values correctly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the database schema to properly enforce uniqueness constraints for privacy settings, so that data integrity is maintained and upsert operations work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database schema is updated THEN there SHALL be a unique constraint on (user_id, conversation_id) combination
2. WHEN the unique constraint is created THEN existing duplicate records SHALL be handled appropriately
3. WHEN the constraint is in place THEN upsert operations SHALL work correctly with the onConflict specification
4. IF there are existing duplicate records THEN the system SHALL preserve the most recent settings and remove duplicates

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the privacy manager code to handle database operations robustly, so that privacy settings updates are reliable and don't cause application errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the privacy manager performs an upsert operation THEN it SHALL use the correct conflict resolution strategy
2. WHEN database constraints are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback behavior
3. WHEN updating privacy settings THEN the system SHALL validate the constraint exists before attempting upsert
4. IF the upsert fails THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error information for debugging
