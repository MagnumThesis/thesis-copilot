# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on optimizing the existing test suite by removing obsolete or redundant tests while preserving critical functionality tests. The goal is to improve test execution performance by implementing a bail mechanism and streamlining the test collection to focus on essential coverage without sacrificing quality assurance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify and remove obsolete tests that are no longer relevant to the current codebase, so that I can reduce test execution time and maintenance overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the test suite THEN the system SHALL identify tests that cover deprecated or removed functionality
2. WHEN a test covers functionality that has been refactored or replaced THEN the system SHALL flag it for review or removal
3. WHEN duplicate test coverage is detected THEN the system SHALL consolidate or remove redundant tests
4. IF a test file has not been updated in over 6 months AND covers deprecated features THEN the system SHALL mark it as potentially obsolete

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to preserve critical tests that ensure core functionality works correctly, so that I maintain confidence in the application's reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating tests for removal THEN the system SHALL preserve tests covering core business logic
2. WHEN a test covers critical user workflows THEN the system SHALL retain it regardless of age
3. WHEN integration tests validate essential system interactions THEN the system SHALL maintain them
4. IF a test covers security, data integrity, or performance requirements THEN the system SHALL classify it as critical

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement a bail mechanism in the test configuration, so that test execution stops after a reasonable number of failures to prevent excessive lag.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the test runner THEN the system SHALL set bail to 10 failures maximum
2. WHEN 10 test failures are reached THEN the test runner SHALL stop execution immediately
3. WHEN the bail limit is triggered THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about which tests failed
4. IF the bail configuration is modified THEN it SHALL be applied to all test execution modes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to categorize tests by importance and execution frequency, so that I can run different test suites based on development context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN categorizing tests THEN the system SHALL classify them as unit, integration, or end-to-end tests
2. WHEN organizing test execution THEN the system SHALL support fast/smoke test runs for quick feedback
3. WHEN running comprehensive tests THEN the system SHALL include all critical and integration tests
4. IF performance tests exist THEN they SHALL be separated into their own execution category

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to update test documentation and organization, so that the test suite structure is clear and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reorganizing tests THEN the system SHALL update file naming conventions for clarity
2. WHEN removing tests THEN the system SHALL document the rationale for removal
3. WHEN preserving tests THEN the system SHALL ensure they have adequate documentation
4. IF test utilities are shared THEN they SHALL be properly organized and documented
