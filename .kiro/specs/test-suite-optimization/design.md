# Design Document

## Overview

The test suite optimization design focuses on creating a streamlined, efficient testing framework that eliminates redundancy while maintaining comprehensive coverage. The current test suite contains over 100 test files with significant overlap, multiple comprehensive test runners, and no bail mechanism for performance optimization.

## Architecture

### Test Classification System

The optimization will implement a three-tier classification system:

1. **Critical Tests** - Core functionality, security, data integrity
2. **Standard Tests** - Feature functionality, integration points
3. **Supplementary Tests** - Edge cases, performance benchmarks

### Test Organization Structure

```
src/tests/
├── core/                    # Critical tests (always run)
│   ├── api.test.ts
│   ├── error-handling.test.ts
│   └── integration-verification.test.ts
├── features/               # Feature-specific tests
│   ├── proofreader/
│   ├── referencer/
│   ├── ai-modes/
│   └── search/
├── performance/           # Performance and benchmark tests
├── accessibility/         # A11y compliance tests
├── utils/                # Test utilities and helpers
└── config/               # Test configuration and setup
```

## Components and Interfaces

### Test Configuration Manager

```typescript
interface TestConfig {
  bail: number
  categories: TestCategory[]
  executionMode: 'fast' | 'comprehensive' | 'ci'
  coverage: CoverageConfig
}

interface TestCategory {
  name: string
  pattern: string
  priority: 'critical' | 'standard' | 'supplementary'
  timeout: number
}
```

### Test Analysis Engine

The engine will analyze existing tests to:
- Identify duplicate test scenarios
- Map tests to requirements
- Detect obsolete functionality coverage
- Calculate test execution metrics

### Test Consolidation Service

Responsible for:
- Merging redundant test files
- Extracting reusable test utilities
- Standardizing test patterns
- Maintaining requirement traceability

## Data Models

### Test Metadata Model

```typescript
interface TestMetadata {
  filePath: string
  requirements: string[]
  lastModified: Date
  executionTime: number
  coverage: number
  dependencies: string[]
  category: TestCategory
  isObsolete: boolean
}
```

### Test Execution Report

```typescript
interface TestExecutionReport {
  totalTests: number
  executedTests: number
  passedTests: number
  failedTests: number
  skippedTests: number
  bailTriggered: boolean
  executionTime: number
  coverageReport: CoverageReport
}
```

## Error Handling

### Bail Mechanism Implementation

- Configure Vitest with `bail: 10` to stop after 10 failures
- Implement graceful shutdown with detailed failure reporting
- Provide clear feedback on which tests caused the bail
- Log execution context for debugging

### Test Failure Recovery

- Categorize failures by type (syntax, logic, environment)
- Provide automated suggestions for common failure patterns
- Implement retry logic for flaky tests
- Generate actionable error reports

## Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Analysis and Classification

1. **Automated Test Analysis**
   - Scan all test files for patterns and dependencies
   - Identify duplicate test scenarios using AST analysis
   - Map tests to requirements and features
   - Generate obsolescence report

2. **Manual Review Process**
   - Review flagged obsolete tests with domain experts
   - Validate critical test classifications
   - Confirm consolidation opportunities

### Phase 2: Consolidation and Optimization

1. **Test File Consolidation**
   - Merge duplicate comprehensive test suites
   - Combine related feature tests into cohesive suites
   - Extract common test utilities and fixtures
   - Standardize test naming and organization

2. **Configuration Optimization**
   - Implement bail mechanism with appropriate threshold
   - Configure test categories for different execution modes
   - Optimize test timeouts and resource allocation
   - Set up coverage thresholds per category

### Phase 3: Validation and Documentation

1. **Regression Testing**
   - Ensure consolidated tests maintain coverage
   - Validate performance improvements
   - Confirm requirement traceability
   - Test bail mechanism functionality

2. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update test documentation and guidelines
   - Create test execution playbooks
   - Document consolidation decisions and rationale
   - Provide maintenance guidelines

## Implementation Approach

### Test Removal Criteria

Tests will be marked for removal if they:
- Cover functionality that has been completely removed
- Are exact duplicates of other tests
- Have not been updated in 6+ months AND cover deprecated features
- Provide no unique coverage value

### Test Preservation Criteria

Tests will be preserved if they:
- Cover critical business logic or security features
- Provide unique edge case coverage
- Test integration points between major components
- Validate accessibility or performance requirements
- Are referenced in requirement traceability matrices

### Consolidation Strategy

1. **Proofreader Tests**: Merge 6 comprehensive test files into 2 focused suites
2. **AI Mode Tests**: Consolidate overlapping integration tests
3. **Performance Tests**: Separate into dedicated performance category
4. **Accessibility Tests**: Maintain as specialized category
5. **Utility Tests**: Extract common patterns into shared utilities

## Performance Optimizations

### Execution Speed Improvements

- Implement test parallelization where safe
- Use test fixtures and mocking to reduce setup time
- Configure appropriate timeouts per test category
- Implement smart test ordering (fast tests first)

### Resource Management

- Configure memory limits for test execution
- Implement cleanup procedures for test artifacts
- Use lazy loading for heavy test dependencies
- Monitor and limit concurrent test processes

### Bail Configuration

```typescript
// vitest.config.ts updates
export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    bail: 10,
    testTimeout: 30000,
    hookTimeout: 10000,
    teardownTimeout: 5000,
    // ... other optimizations
  }
})
```

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Test Health Metrics

- Test execution time trends
- Failure rate by category
- Coverage percentage by component
- Bail trigger frequency
- Test maintenance burden

### Quality Indicators

- Requirement coverage completeness
- Test code duplication percentage
- Average test execution time
- Flaky test identification
- Technical debt in test code

This design ensures a maintainable, efficient test suite that provides confidence in the application while minimizing execution time and maintenance overhead.
