# AI Searcher Component Refactor - Requirements

## Introduction

The AISearcher component in `src/components/ui/ai-searcher.tsx` is a comprehensive AI-powered academic reference search interface. With over 1000 lines of code, it has become difficult to maintain and understand. This refactor aims to break down the component into smaller, more manageable pieces while preserving all existing functionality.

The refactor will focus on separating concerns by extracting logical sections of the component into smaller, reusable components. This will improve code readability, maintainability, and testability.

## Requirements

1. **As a developer, I want the AISearcher component to be broken down into smaller components, so that it becomes easier to maintain and understand.**

   1.1. The main AISearcher component shall be reduced to less than 300 lines of code.
   
   1.2. Logical sections of the component shall be extracted into separate, well-named components.
   
   1.3. Each extracted component shall have a single responsibility principle.
   
   1.4. All existing functionality shall be preserved after the refactor.

2. **As a developer, I want the state management to be organized, so that it's easier to track and debug component behavior.**

   2.1. Related state variables shall be grouped together logically.
   
   2.2. Complex state management shall be extracted into custom hooks where appropriate.
   
   2.3. State updates shall be predictable and well-documented.
   
   2.4. All state-related logic shall be encapsulated appropriately.

3. **As a developer, I want the API interactions to be centralized, so that network requests are easier to manage and test.**

   3.1. All API calls shall be extracted into a dedicated service module.
   
   3.2. API error handling shall be consistent across all requests.
   
   3.3. Loading states shall be properly managed for all API interactions.
   
   3.4. Mock data implementations shall be maintained for development/testing purposes.

4. **As a developer, I want the component to follow React best practices, so that it aligns with modern development standards.**

   4.1. Components shall use functional components with hooks instead of class components.
   
   4.2. Props shall be properly typed using TypeScript interfaces.
   
   4.3. Components shall follow a consistent naming convention.
   
   4.4. Code shall be properly formatted and follow the project's linting rules.

5. **As a user, I want the refactor to not change the UI/UX, so that my experience remains consistent.**

   5.1. The visual appearance of the component shall remain unchanged.
   
   5.2. All interactive elements shall maintain their current behavior.
   
   5.3. Performance shall be maintained or improved after the refactor.
   
   5.4. All existing features shall be accessible in the same way as before.

6. **As a tester, I want the refactored code to be easily testable, so that I can verify functionality with unit tests.**

   6.1. Components shall be exported for testing purposes.
   
   6.2. Business logic shall be separated from UI logic to enable unit testing.
   
   6.3. API service modules shall be designed to allow for easy mocking.
   
   6.4. Components shall have clear input/output interfaces.

7. **As a maintainer, I want the code to be well-documented, so that future developers can understand and modify it easily.**

   7.1. Each component shall have clear JSDoc comments explaining its purpose.
   
   7.2. Complex logic shall be documented with inline comments.
   
   7.3. Component interfaces shall be clearly defined with TypeScript types.
   
   7.4. The overall architecture shall be documented in a design document.
