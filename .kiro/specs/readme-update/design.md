# Design Document

## Overview

The README redesign will transform the current template-focused documentation into a product-centric introduction to Thesis Copilot. The design prioritizes user understanding and engagement while maintaining essential technical information for developers. The structure will follow a progressive disclosure pattern, leading with product value and drilling down to technical details.

### Usability Testing
- **Scan Test**: Can users quickly understand what the product does?
- **Navigation Test**: Can users easily find relevant documentation?
- **Technical Access**: Can developers quickly access setup information?
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Does the information flow logically from general to specific?

### Implementation Validation
