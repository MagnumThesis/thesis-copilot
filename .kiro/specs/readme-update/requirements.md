# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current README.md file focuses primarily on the technical stack (React + Vite + Hono + Cloudflare Workers) rather than clearly communicating what the Thesis Copilot product is and what value it provides to users. This update will transform the README to be product-focused while maintaining essential technical information for developers.
