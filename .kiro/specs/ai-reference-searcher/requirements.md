# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI-Powered Reference Searcher is an enhancement to the existing Referencer Tool that enables users to automatically discover relevant academic references based on their content from Ideas and Builder tools. This feature uses AI-powered content analysis and Google Scholar integration to suggest high-quality academic sources that are relevant to the user's research topic.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to extract content from my Ideas and Builder tools to use as search context, so that I can find references relevant to my specific research content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the AI searcher THEN the system SHALL provide options to select content from Ideas or Builder tools
2. WHEN a user selects Ideas content THEN the system SHALL extract and display relevant text and keywords
3. WHEN a user selects Builder content THEN the system SHALL extract and display relevant text and keywords
4. WHEN content is extracted THEN the system SHALL show a preview of the content that will be used for search
5. WHEN content extraction fails THEN the system SHALL provide manual search query input as fallback

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the system to automatically generate intelligent search queries from my content, so that I can find the most relevant academic papers without manually crafting search terms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is extracted THEN the system SHALL automatically generate search queries based on key topics and terms
2. WHEN search queries are generated THEN the system SHALL allow users to review and modify them before searching
3. WHEN multiple content sources are selected THEN the system SHALL combine and optimize search queries
4. WHEN search queries are too broad THEN the system SHALL suggest more specific terms
5. WHEN search queries are too narrow THEN the system SHALL suggest broader or alternative terms

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to search Google Scholar for academic papers, so that I can find high-quality, peer-reviewed sources for my research.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates a search THEN the system SHALL query Google Scholar with the generated search terms
2. WHEN search results are returned THEN the system SHALL parse and extract metadata (title, authors, journal, year, citations)
3. WHEN search results include DOIs THEN the system SHALL extract and validate DOI information
4. WHEN search results include abstracts THEN the system SHALL extract and display abstract text
5. WHEN search fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry options
6. WHEN rate limits are reached THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate throttling and user notification

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want search results to be ranked by relevance and quality, so that I can focus on the most valuable sources for my research.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN search results are displayed THEN the system SHALL rank them by relevance to the original content
2. WHEN ranking results THEN the system SHALL consider citation count, publication date, and journal quality
3. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL show confidence scores and relevance indicators
4. WHEN results have low confidence THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate this to the user
5. WHEN duplicate results are found THEN the system SHALL remove or merge them appropriately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to easily add suggested references to my reference library, so that I can build my bibliography efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing search results THEN the system SHALL provide "Add to References" buttons for each result
2. WHEN a user adds a reference THEN the system SHALL automatically populate all available metadata fields
3. WHEN adding a reference THEN the system SHALL check for duplicates in the existing library
4. WHEN duplicates are detected THEN the system SHALL warn the user and offer merge options
5. WHEN references are added THEN the system SHALL track which were added via AI search for analytics

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to provide feedback on search results, so that the system can learn and improve future suggestions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing search results THEN the system SHALL provide options to mark results as relevant or irrelevant
2. WHEN users provide feedback THEN the system SHALL store this information for learning purposes
3. WHEN feedback is collected THEN the system SHALL use it to improve future search result ranking
4. WHEN users consistently reject certain types of results THEN the system SHALL adjust future searches accordingly
5. WHEN feedback patterns emerge THEN the system SHALL update confidence scoring algorithms

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to access my search history and analytics, so that I can track my research patterns and improve my search strategies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users perform searches THEN the system SHALL store search history with timestamps and results
2. WHEN users view search history THEN the system SHALL display past searches with success rates
3. WHEN users review analytics THEN the system SHALL show trends in search topics and successful discoveries
4. WHEN users want privacy THEN the system SHALL allow clearing of search history
5. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL provide search history in standard formats

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want advanced search features and filters, so that I can refine my searches for more targeted results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing searches THEN the system SHALL provide filters for publication date ranges
2. WHEN filtering results THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by author, journal, or citation count
3. WHEN results are extensive THEN the system SHALL provide pagination and sorting options
4. WHEN users want to save searches THEN the system SHALL provide bookmarking functionality
5. WHEN comparing results THEN the system SHALL provide side-by-side comparison features
