# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The codebase contains several large, complex files that handle multiple responsibilities, making them difficult to maintain, test, and understand. Key files requiring refactoring include:

- `use-ai-mode-manager.ts` (1,233 lines) - manages AI mode state, error handling, performance optimization, API calls, and UI logic
- `ai-searcher-api.ts` (2,714 lines) - handles API routing, request processing, error handling, analytics, and multiple service integrations
- `ai-error-handler.ts` (785 lines) - comprehensive error handling with network retry logic and graceful degradation
- `ai-performance-optimizer.ts` (665 lines) - caching, debouncing, and performance optimizations

This refactoring effort aims to break down these monolithic files into smaller, focused modules that follow the Single Responsibility Principle and improve code maintainability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the `use-ai-mode-manager.ts` hook to be broken down into smaller, focused modules, so that I can easily understand, maintain, and test individual pieces of functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring `use-ai-mode-manager.ts` THEN the system SHALL extract state management logic into separate hooks
2. WHEN creating new hooks THEN each hook SHALL manage a single aspect of AI mode functionality (e.g., error state, processing state, modify mode state)
3. WHEN breaking out functionality THEN the original `UseAIModeManager` interface SHALL remain unchanged
4. WHEN extracting logic THEN the main hook SHALL compose smaller hooks to maintain the same API surface

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the `ai-searcher-api.ts` file to be broken down into focused route handlers and service modules, so that I can maintain and test individual API endpoints independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring `ai-searcher-api.ts` THEN the system SHALL extract individual route handlers into separate files
2. WHEN creating route handlers THEN each handler SHALL focus on a single API endpoint (search, extract, generate, etc.)
3. WHEN extracting services THEN shared logic SHALL be moved to dedicated service modules
4. WHEN breaking down the API THEN the existing route structure and response formats SHALL remain unchanged

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the `ai-error-handler.ts` file to be split into focused error handling modules, so that I can manage different types of errors independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring `ai-error-handler.ts` THEN the system SHALL extract network error handling into a separate module
2. WHEN creating error modules THEN validation errors SHALL be handled in a dedicated validation module
3. WHEN splitting error handling THEN recovery strategies SHALL be extracted into a separate strategy module
4. WHEN error modules are created THEN the main `AIErrorHandler` class SHALL compose these modules while maintaining the same public API

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the `ai-performance-optimizer.ts` file to be broken down into focused optimization modules, so that I can manage caching, debouncing, and metrics independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring `ai-performance-optimizer.ts` THEN the system SHALL extract caching logic into a dedicated cache module
2. WHEN creating optimization modules THEN debouncing logic SHALL be separated into its own module
3. WHEN splitting performance logic THEN metrics collection SHALL be extracted into a separate metrics module
4. WHEN optimization modules are created THEN the main `AIPerformanceOptimizer` class SHALL orchestrate these modules while maintaining the same interface

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want shared utility functions to be extracted from large files into focused utility modules, so that I can easily find and reuse common functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN utility functions are identified in large files THEN they SHALL be extracted into domain-specific utility modules
2. WHEN creating utility modules THEN validation utilities SHALL be grouped separately from formatting utilities
3. WHEN utility functions are extracted THEN they SHALL be pure functions where possible
4. WHEN utility modules are created THEN they SHALL include comprehensive unit tests and clear documentation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configuration and type definitions to be extracted from implementation files, so that I can manage configuration separately from business logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration objects are identified in large files THEN they SHALL be extracted into dedicated configuration modules
2. WHEN creating configuration modules THEN they SHALL provide type-safe configuration interfaces
3. WHEN configuration is extracted THEN it SHALL be easily modifiable without touching implementation code
4. WHEN configuration modules are created THEN they SHALL include validation and default value handling

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the refactored code to maintain backward compatibility, so that existing functionality continues to work without modification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring is complete THEN all existing public APIs SHALL remain unchanged
2. WHEN modules are extracted THEN the original entry points SHALL continue to work
3. WHEN refactoring is applied THEN all existing tests SHALL continue to pass
4. WHEN new modules are created THEN they SHALL be properly exported and accessible

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation and examples for the new modular structure, so that I can understand how to use and extend the refactored code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN modules are created THEN each module SHALL have comprehensive JSDoc documentation
2. WHEN refactoring is complete THEN a migration guide SHALL be provided
3. WHEN new structure is implemented THEN code examples SHALL demonstrate proper usage patterns
4. WHEN documentation is created THEN it SHALL include architectural diagrams showing module relationships
