# Proofreader Tool User Guide

## Overview

The Proofreader Tool is an AI-powered analysis feature that helps you identify potential issues and areas for improvement in your thesis proposal. Unlike other tools that modify your content, the Proofreader provides structured feedback that you can review and address at your own pace.

## Getting Started

### Accessing the Proofreader

1. Open any conversation/idea in Thesis Copilot
2. Look for the **Tools** panel on the right side of the screen
3. Click the toggle button (arrow icon) to expand the Tools panel
4. Click on the **Proofreader** tool card

The Proofreader will open in a side panel, showing your current conversation title and analysis options.

### Prerequisites

For the best analysis results, ensure you have:
- Content in your Builder tool (thesis proposal text)
- Idea definitions in your Idealist tool (optional but recommended for contextual analysis)

## Using the Proofreader

### Running an Analysis

1. **Start Analysis**: Click the "Analyze Content" button
2. **Content Retrieval**: The tool automatically retrieves your thesis content from the Builder tool
3. **Context Loading**: If available, idea definitions from the Idealist tool are loaded for context
4. **AI Analysis**: Your content is analyzed for various concerns and issues
5. **Results Display**: Identified concerns are displayed in a structured list

### Understanding Analysis Results

The Proofreader categorizes concerns into several types:

#### Concern Categories

- **Clarity**: Issues with unclear explanations or confusing language
- **Coherence**: Problems with logical flow and connection between ideas
- **Structure**: Issues with document organization and section arrangement
- **Academic Style**: Problems with academic tone, formality, and writing style
- **Consistency**: Contradictions or inconsistent terminology usage
- **Completeness**: Missing sections or insufficient detail
- **Citations**: Issues with references and citation formatting
- **Grammar**: Basic grammar and syntax problems
- **Terminology**: Inconsistent or unclear use of technical terms

#### Severity Levels

Each concern is assigned a severity level:
- **Critical**: Major issues that significantly impact your thesis
- **High**: Important issues that should be addressed
- **Medium**: Moderate issues worth considering
- **Low**: Minor suggestions for improvement

### Managing Concerns

#### Concern Status Tracking

Each concern can be marked with one of three statuses:

1. **To be done** (default): Concerns that need attention
2. **Addressed**: Concerns you have resolved
3. **Rejected**: Concerns you've decided not to address

#### Updating Concern Status

1. Click on any concern to expand its details
2. Use the status buttons to change the concern status
3. Changes are automatically saved and synced

#### Filtering Concerns

Use the filter options to view concerns by:
- Status (To be done, Addressed, Rejected, or All)
- Category type
- Severity level

4. **Re-analyze When Needed**: Run new analysis after making significant changes

## Troubleshooting
