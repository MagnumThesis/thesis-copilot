# AI Reference Searcher User Guide

The AI Reference Searcher is a powerful feature that helps you find relevant academic references for your research automatically. It integrates with Google Scholar to search for papers based on your content from the Ideas and Builder tools.

## Getting Started

To access the AI Reference Searcher:

1. Open the Reference Manager by clicking the reference icon in the toolbar
2. Navigate to the "AI Searcher" tab
3. You'll see the AI Searcher interface with options to search for references

## Searching for References

### Method 1: Manual Search
1. Enter your search query directly in the search box
2. Click the "Search" button
3. Browse through the ranked results with relevance scores
4. Click "Add Reference" to add any result to your library

### Method 2: Content-Based Search
1. Click "Show Content Selection" to open the content source selector
2. Select content from your Ideas or Builder tools
3. The system will automatically generate search queries from your selected content
4. Review and modify the generated queries if needed
5. Click "Search" to find relevant references

## Understanding Search Results

Search results are ranked and scored based on multiple factors:

- **Relevance Score**: How closely the paper matches your search query
- **Quality Score**: Based on citation count, journal reputation, and publication date
- **Confidence Score**: How reliable the extracted metadata is

Each result shows:
- Title and authors
- Journal and publication year
- Citation count
- Abstract (when available)
- DOI and URL links

## Managing Search Results

### Adding References
Click "Add Reference" on any search result to add it to your reference library. The system will:
- Automatically populate all available metadata
- Check for duplicates in your existing library
- Warn you about potential duplicates

### Providing Feedback
Help improve future search results by providing feedback:
- Use the quick feedback buttons (üëç/üëé) for relevance
- Click "Feedback" for detailed quality ratings
- Your feedback helps the system learn your preferences

### Advanced Features
- **Query Refinement**: Click "Refine" to get suggestions for improving your search query
- **Filters**: Click "Filters" to narrow results by date range, authors, journals, or citation count
- **Sorting**: Sort results by relevance, date, citations, or quality

## Duplicate Management

The system automatically detects and handles duplicates:
- Results are checked against your existing library
- Duplicate detection is based on DOI, title, and author similarity
- You can configure deduplication settings in the search options

## Privacy and Data Management

Your search history and analytics are stored locally:
- Click "Privacy" to manage your search data
- You can clear your search history at any time
- All data is stored securely and never shared without your consent

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Search returns no results:**
- Try broadening your search terms
- Check that your query is not too specific
- Consider using more general academic terms

**Search is slow or failing:**
- Google Scholar may be temporarily unavailable
- Check your internet connection
- Try again in a few minutes

**References not adding to library:**
- Ensure all required fields (title, authors) are present
- Check for validation errors in the reference form
- Try adding manually if automatic addition fails

### Rate Limiting

To ensure fair usage, the system implements rate limiting:
- Maximum 10 searches per minute
- Maximum 100 searches per hour
- Exceeding limits will temporarily block further searches

## Best Practices

1. **Use content-based search** for the most relevant results
2. **Provide feedback** to help improve the system
3. **Review generated queries** before searching
4. **Use filters** to narrow down large result sets
5. **Check for duplicates** before adding references
