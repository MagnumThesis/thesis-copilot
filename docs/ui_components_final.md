## Component Architecture Patterns

### State Management
Most UI components follow a consistent pattern for state management:
1. Local state for UI interactions (visibility, loading states, etc.)
2. Props for data display and configuration
3. Callback props for user interactions
4. Integration with global state management systems (where applicable)

### Accessibility
All components implement proper accessibility features:
1. ARIA attributes for screen readers
2. Keyboard navigation support
3. Proper focus management
4. Semantic HTML structure

### Performance
Components are optimized for performance:
1. Memoization for expensive calculations
2. Virtual scrolling for large lists
3. Lazy loading for heavy components
4. Efficient re-rendering strategies

### Error Handling
Components include robust error handling:
1. Graceful degradation for failed operations
2. User-friendly error messages
3. Recovery options and retry mechanisms
4. Logging for debugging purposes
