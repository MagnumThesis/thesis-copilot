- You have existing content and want to expand it
- You're in the middle of writing and need help continuing
- You want to maintain consistency with existing text
- You have a good foundation but need more detail

### How to Use Continue Mode

1. **Position Your Cursor**
   - Place cursor at the end of existing content
   - Or select text to use as context for continuation

2. **Activate Continue Mode**
   - Click the "Continue" button in the AI Action Toolbar

4. **Review and Apply**
   - Review how well the continuation fits
   - Accept, reject, or regenerate as needed

### Continue Mode Best Practices

#### Provide Sufficient Context
- Have at least 2-3 sentences before using continue mode
- Ensure your existing content has a clear direction
- End at natural continuation points

#### Good Continuation Points
- End of a paragraph that introduces a concept
- After listing main points that need elaboration
- Middle of a section that needs more detail
- After stating a thesis that needs support

#### Example Usage

**Existing Content:**
```markdown
## Literature Review

The field of artificial intelligence has seen rapid advancement in recent years, particularly in the area of natural language processing. Recent studies have shown significant improvements in language model capabilities.
```

**After Continue Mode:**
```markdown
## Literature Review

The field of artificial intelligence has seen rapid advancement in recent years, particularly in the area of natural language processing. Recent studies have shown significant improvements in language model capabilities. These improvements have been driven by advances in transformer architectures, increased computational resources, and the availability of large-scale training datasets.

Furthermore, the application of these models to academic research has opened new possibilities for automated text analysis, content generation, and research assistance. However, challenges remain in ensuring accuracy, avoiding bias, and maintaining academic integrity when using AI-generated content.

## Using Modify Mode

### When to Use Modify Mode
- Improving clarity of existing text
- Changing the tone or style
- Expanding brief content with more detail
- Summarizing lengthy passages
- Rewriting for better flow

### How to Use Modify Mode

1. **Select Text**
   - Highlight the text you want to modify
   - Select meaningful chunks (sentences or paragraphs)
   - Minimum 3 characters, maximum 5000 characters

2. **Activate Modify Mode**
   - Click the "Modify" button (enabled when text is selected)
   - Or use the keyboard shortcut: `Ctrl+M`

3. **Choose Modification Type**
   - **Rewrite**: Improve clarity, flow, and academic quality
   - **Expand**: Add more detail, examples, and supporting information
   - **Summarize**: Condense to capture essential points concisely
   - **Improve Clarity**: Enhance readability and simplify complex sentences
   - **Custom Prompt**: Provide your own modification instructions

4. **Preview Changes**
   - See original and modified text side-by-side
   - Compare the changes carefully
   - Ensure the modification meets your needs

5. **Apply or Regenerate**
   - Accept the changes to replace the original text
   - Reject to keep the original
   - Regenerate for a different version

### Modification Types Explained

#### Rewrite
**Purpose:** Improve overall quality while maintaining meaning
**Good for:** Awkward sentences, unclear expressions, poor flow

**Example:**
- **Original:** "The thing about machine learning is that it's really complicated and has lots of different parts that work together in ways that are hard to understand."
- **Rewritten:** "Machine learning systems consist of complex, interconnected components that interact through sophisticated algorithms, making their behavior challenging to interpret and predict."

#### Expand
**Purpose:** Add detail, examples, and supporting information
**Good for:** Brief statements that need elaboration, outline points

**Example:**
- **Original:** "Social media affects mental health."
- **Expanded:** "Social media platforms significantly impact mental health through multiple mechanisms, including social comparison, cyberbullying, sleep disruption, and addictive usage patterns. Research has shown correlations between heavy social media use and increased rates of anxiety, depression, and body image issues, particularly among adolescents and young adults."

#### Summarize
**Purpose:** Condense content while preserving key points
**Good for:** Lengthy passages, verbose explanations, redundant content

**Example:**
- **Original:** "The research methodology employed in this study involves a comprehensive mixed-methods approach that combines quantitative data collection through structured surveys distributed to a representative sample of participants, along with qualitative data gathering through in-depth semi-structured interviews conducted with a subset of survey respondents to gain deeper insights into their experiences and perspectives."
- **Summarized:** "This study uses a mixed-methods approach combining quantitative surveys with qualitative interviews to gather comprehensive data on participant experiences."

#### Improve Clarity
**Purpose:** Make text more readable and understandable
**Good for:** Complex sentences, jargon-heavy text, confusing explanations

**Example:**
- **Original:** "The utilization of advanced computational methodologies facilitates the optimization of algorithmic performance parameters."
- **Clarified:** "Using advanced computer methods helps improve how well algorithms perform."

#### Custom Prompt
**Purpose:** Apply specific modifications based on your instructions
**Good for:** Unique requirements, specific style changes, targeted improvements

**Example Custom Prompts:**
- "Make this more formal and academic"
- "Add specific examples and case studies"
- "Convert to passive voice for academic style"
- "Simplify for undergraduate-level understanding"
