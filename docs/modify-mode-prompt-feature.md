## Overview

The AI Builder Integration now supports a **Custom Prompt** modification type, allowing users to provide specific instructions for how they want their selected text to be modified.

### 3. Custom Prompt Input (New Feature)

When you select "Custom Prompt":

- A text input dialog appears
- Enter specific instructions (e.g., "Make this more technical and add examples")
- Use the lightbulb icon to see suggested prompts
- Submit with Ctrl+Enter or click "Modify Text"

### 4. Preview and Apply
